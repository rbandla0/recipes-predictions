# Problem Identification

For this project, I wanted to predict the number of calories from a recipe and this is a regression type prediction. The response variable in this prediction is calories because this gives me the number of calories in a recipe. Since this is a regression type, I will be using the root mean squared error as the metric to evaluate my model. I chose this one becuase I can tell if my model is overfitting, underfitting, or generalizing by analyzing the RMSE of the training and testing data. At the time of prediction, when the recipe is given, you would know the ingredients, number of steps, the number of carbs, proteins, etc. in this recipe.
